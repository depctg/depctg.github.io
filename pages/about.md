I am a final year PhD student at the University of California San Diego, major in Computer Science.

I am now a part of the [Wuklab](http://wuklab.io/) and [SysNet](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/) group in UCSD, and luckily advised by [Prof. Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/).
I focus on building efficient, performant, and scalable next generation datacenter systems, through **resource disaggregation** and **co-design of application, software and hardware stacks**.
My research interests span Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Computer Architecture, and Programming Languages.
