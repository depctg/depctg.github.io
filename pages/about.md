I’m Zhiyuan Guo. I’m currently a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego, major in Computer Science. I am now a part of the [Wuklab](http://wuklab.io/) and [SysNet](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/) group in UCSD, and luckily advised by [Prof. Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/). I'm interesting in and working on research ideas that improves **resource effiency** in datacenter, from designing new **resource disaggregated hardware** to building **operating system, runtime and programming language** support. I got my bachelor degree from Beihang University, Beijing in 2019.
